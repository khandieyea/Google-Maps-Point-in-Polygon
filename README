This is a Javascript Google Maps extension for the GPolygon class to detect whether or not a point resides within it. Included is a sample HTML page that makes use of it to demonstrate usage.

Simplest Usage:

var coordinate = new google.maps.LatLng(40, -90);
var polygon = new google.maps.Polygon([..paths..], "#000000", 1, 1, "#336699", 0.3);
var isWithinPolygon = polygon.containsLatLng(coordinate);

Or if you have a Marker


var isWithinPolygon = polygon.containsLatLng(marker.getPosition());
